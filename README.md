# 📌 Overview

Differential leukocyte counting is essential for hematological diagnosis.  
Manual smear analysis remains time-consuming, subjective, and sensitive to staining variability between laboratories.

This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation between:

- YOLOv11 (Nano, Small, Medium)
- Vision Transformers (ViT-Small, ViT-Base)

for **14-class leukocyte and artifact classification** using a public dataset published on Zenodo:

[![Dataset DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17743609.svg)](https://zenodo.org/records/17743609)

Additionally, we evaluate the impact of **HistAuGAN**, a generative adversarial stain augmentation strategy designed to simulate realistic inter-laboratory staining variability and improve domain robustness.

# 🔍 Model Explainability

To analyze model decision patterns we generated attention and activation maps using:

• **Attention Rollout** for Vision Transformers  
• **EigenCAM** for YOLOv11 architectures  

These visualizations highlight the morphological regions most relevant to model predictions.

Examples are provided in the dissertation appendix.
